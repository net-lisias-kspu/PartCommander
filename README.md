## Description

Tired of playing "sniper" trying to access a part's right-click menu while hurtling through space? Ever wish you could access those options while in IVA or Map View? Don't feel like setting up action groups for everything? Then Part Commander is for you! Part Commander consolidates all the right-click menus from parts on the active vessel into a single interface (with the optional ability to "pop off" selected parts into their own windows if you wish).

* consolidates all right-click menus into a single resizable, movable, scrollable window.
* optional ability to pop off parts into their own windows for monitoring.
* "Symmetry Lockï»¿" feature lets you control all parts within a symmetry group at once. Displayed values are obtained from the "primary" part.
* part highlighting so you know which part(s) you're affecting. With symmetrical parts, the primary one is highlighted in orange and the rest in yellow.
* works in both IVA and Map views.
* stock and blizzy78 toolbar support.
* persistent storage of window locations/sizes and selected parts per save.
* filter and sort the part list.
* hide "unactionable" parts.
* toggle resource/temp/aero info display.
* configurable hot key (defaults to Mod+P).
